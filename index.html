                <h1>Why I'm Running</h1>
                <h3 class="bigBlurb">I was born a West Texas girl. My years of living outside West Texas have taught me
                    that West Texas women really are different. We know how to work. If something needs doing, we
                    do it. Now, after
                    decades of one-party rule, Texas has huge problems. Ignored by our Legislature for years, we have
                    sunk to the bottom rung of states in so many areas: health, education, child protection,
                    infrastructure, the electric grid. We sure can't brag about being #1 in uninsured citizens.
                    <br><br>
                    It is time for a change! No more Good Ol' Boys falling in line like timid sheep. It's time for the
                    Legislature to solve real problems for the hard-working people of Texas. It's time to send our West
                    Texas git-'er-done spirit to Austin.

            <div class="aboutBlurb">
                <!-- image here? -->
                <h3 class="blurb">Linda was born and raised in Abilene, attending College Heights and North Junior High.
                    Her father, T.W. "Jack" Dean, was on the music faculty at Hardin-Simmons University. Her mother,
                    Frances, had her hands full with four children and no clothes dryer.
                    <br><br>
                    Linda's most memorable 5th grade experience was being cast in The Pied Piper of Hamlin.
                    Schoolchildren from all over the city were bussed to Fair Park Auditorium to see this play. In the
                    9th grade she moved to Fort Worth with her family and graduated from Paschal High School. Then -
                    ahead of her time - she took a "Gap Year," working for six months as a Stewardess before going off
                    to college.
                    <br><br>
                    At Baylor, Linda majored in Political Science and met Arthur Goolsbee, a former Marine returning
                    tocollegeon the GI bill. After their marriage she worked to put him through the University of Texas
                    Law School. Eventually they moved to Los Angeles and lived there for 33 years, where Art was
                    Director of Finance for Utility Trailer Manufacturing. Linda was actively involved in raising their
                    son Austan and working for Pacific Bell as a manager in large business sales and installation,
                    corporate course design, and customer training.
                    <br><br>
                    Regular visits to the Dean home near View gave their Waco-born son the chance to fish in the stock
                    tank and experience the wide-open spaces of West Texas. Austan grew up to become a Professor at the
                    University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Chairman of the Economic Advisors in the first
                    Obama Administration.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2004 Linda and Art retired to Abilene to be near her family and became deeply connected to West
                    Texas through their church and other community groups until Art's passing in 2021. His new
                    hometown-by-choice was blessed by his service as an ordained Episcopal Deacon, a United Way Board
                    member, Associate Judge of the Abilene Municipal Court, and active participant in other community
                    organizations. Linda feels called to continue his example of service.
